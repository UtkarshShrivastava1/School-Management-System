Lets make a class management controller or controllers which can do:
-first fetch all the classes in the system and allow user to modify its name, its subjects,
 its teachers etc
-user must have ability to delete/edit a class, view subjects and teachers of the selected class also delete/edit subjects or change/remove teachers. in short full possible control and ease to user.
