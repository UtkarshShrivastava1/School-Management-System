-assign students to the classes in most easy way.
- On student schema and student registration for add a new feild class_registered_for(which will be  a intermideate information state before actualy asigning student a class).
- add a functionality at student to the class assignment system to show the list of students of a given class that they registered for.

for example if a student have class_registered_for= 10
then while assigning a class to a student there will be a filter to select standard(lets say 10) and name of only those students will show who are class_registered_for= 10.
